# SIM-Project-
     It a Project documentry On " On Simulation Method of Small Life Insurance PortfoliosSmall life Insurance Portfolios "
in Python.

Here new Simulation Method and Old Acturial Simulation Method are discussed by demonstrating thorugh an example based on life insurance 
primiums which gives more Positivly oriented Primium Value

We can see a senerio by inputing these values 

current_invesment = 100000
average_return= 0.1120 (i.e. 11.20%)
st_dev_return = 0.18 (i.e. 0.18%)
time_to_retirement = 20
amount_to_invest_anu = 20000

It runs Over 1000 simultions to simulate more positvly oriented value of cash flow
and these end value of cash-flow is more positively then the Acturial Method
